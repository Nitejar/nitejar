Collections are schema-defined stores for reusable operational data.

## Common uses

- Incident inventories
- Customer account facts
- Release checklists
- Project status rollups

## Operating model

1. Define a schema.
2. Approve it in admin.
3. Let agents query or write rows through collection tools.
4. Audit changes in activity logs.

Use collections when data should be shared across agents and runs.
