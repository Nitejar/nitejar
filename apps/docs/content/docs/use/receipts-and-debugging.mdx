title: Receipts and Debugging
description: Trace what happened, why it happened, and what it cost.

When behavior surprises you, inspect artifacts in this order.

## Debug path

1. **Activity timeline**: Did the webhook parse and dispatch correctly?
2. **Run trace**: Which model calls and tool calls happened?
3. **Delivery outcome**: Was the response delivered to the channel?
4. **Cost breakdown**: Which step drove spend?
5. **Plugin event logs**: Did the integration reject or retry?

## Fast triage checklist

- Confirm the right agent handled the message.
- Confirm queue mode behavior (`steer`, `collect`, `followup`).
- Confirm tool outputs matched prompt intent.
- Confirm delivery succeeded with channel metadata.

<Callout type="info" title="Where to verify">
Use **Admin > Activity** for timeline and run steps, **Admin > Costs** for spend, and each plugin instance detail page for webhook/event logs.
</Callout>
