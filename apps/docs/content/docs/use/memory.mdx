title: Memory
description: Persistent context per agent for facts that should survive sessions.
---

Memory lets agents carry forward durable context between runs.

## Use memory for

- Stable preferences and operating constraints
- Long-running tasks that need continuity
- Known facts worth reusing across sessions

## Operational guidance

- Keep memories specific and low-noise.
- Pin only high-value facts.
- Remove stale assumptions as reality changes.
