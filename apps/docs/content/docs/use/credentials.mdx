title: Credentials
description: Secure secret access for plugins and agent tools.
---

Credentials store sensitive tokens and keys used by agents and plugins.

## Safe usage pattern

1. Add credentials in admin.
2. Scope access to the minimum required agents.
3. Rotate tokens when ownership changes.
4. Re-test integrations after rotation.

Dangerous actions here are irreversible if mishandled. Use clear naming, least privilege, and explicit ownership.

Open **Admin > Credentials** for stored entries and assignment scope. Validate runtime use in **Admin > Activity** by checking tool and plugin events that consume credentials.
