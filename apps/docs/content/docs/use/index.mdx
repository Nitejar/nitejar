title: Use Nitejar
description: Operate your fleet, ship work, and verify every run.
---

Nitejar is built for operators who want speed without guesswork. Your fleet can triage, draft, sync, and alert across channels. You can always inspect what happened in the activity timeline, execution logs, and cost breakdowns.

## Core flow

1. Configure agents and skills for each job.
2. Connect plugins for Telegram, GitHub, or webhooks.
3. Watch live work in **Activity**.
4. Verify spend and limits in **Costs**.
5. Tune behavior with tools, memory, collections, and evals.

Open **Admin > Activity** for per-run timelines and **Admin > Costs** for spend by agent and model. Those two views are your operational source of truth.
