description: Give agents reusable playbooks without changing runtime code.

Skills are reusable knowledge packs. They tell agents how to execute a workflow with consistent structure.

## What skills are good for

- Repeating team playbooks (incident triage, release checks, PR review)
- Standard output formats (status posts, summaries, customer replies)
- Domain-specific instructions and references

## How to run skills in operations

1. Create or import a skill in **Admin > Skills**.
2. Assign it to one agent, a team, or globally.
3. Set priority and auto-inject as needed.
4. Validate behavior in live runs.

Use skills for guidance. Use plugins when you need new integration handlers or new tools.

Open **Admin > Skills** to inspect source and assignments. Then open **Admin > Activity** and check run traces for `use_skill` and related tool calls.
