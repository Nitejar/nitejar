title: Routines
description: Recurring automated runs for predictable operational work.

Routines schedule repeat work: daily digests, backlog sweeps, and regular checks.

## Good routine candidates

- Morning issue triage
- Daily release readiness summary
- Weekly cost anomaly scan
- Plugin health checks

## Guardrails

- Keep prompts narrow and outcome-focused.
- Tie each routine to clear verification outputs.
- Put spend limits in place before scaling frequency.
