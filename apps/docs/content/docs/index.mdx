Nitejar is a self-hosted AI agent fleet for teams that want automation with clear evidence. Your agents can triage, draft, sync, and alert across Telegram, GitHub, and webhooks. Every run leaves a traceable activity timeline, execution log, and cost breakdown.

## Features

Nitejar focuses on operational workflows, not toy demos. Core capabilities today:

- **Fleet operations**: Configure multiple agents with separate identity, soul, tools, and limits.
- **Channel integrations**: Receive and respond through Telegram, GitHub, and generic webhooks.
- **Skills**: Attach reusable playbooks so agents follow your team’s process.
- **Tools and sandboxes**: Give agents controlled execution and data access.
- **Collections and memory**: Persist structured data and long-lived context.
- **Evals**: Score quality and catch behavior regressions.
- **Routines**: Schedule recurring runs for daily or weekly workflows.
- **Credentials**: Store secrets safely and scope access per agent.
- **Costs and budgets**: Track spend per run, model, and agent with budget controls.
- **Receipts and debugging**: Audit what happened, when, and why from the timeline.

Open **Admin > Activity** for execution timelines and **Admin > Costs** for spend analysis. Those two views are the fastest way to confirm what your fleet actually did.
