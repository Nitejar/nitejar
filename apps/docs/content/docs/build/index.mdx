This lane is for contributors and extension developers.

## Start points

- **[Architecture and Runtime](/build/architecture-and-runtime)**
- **[Plugin SDK](/build/plugins)**
- **[Skills Authoring](/build/skills-authoring)**
- **[Contributing](/build/contributing)**

## What belongs here

- Runtime internals and package boundaries
- Plugin interfaces and manifests
- Contract tests and contributor workflow
- Data flow and reliability guarantees

If you only need to operate agents, use **[Use Nitejar](/use)** instead.
