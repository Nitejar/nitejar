**Title:** Redesign UI inspired by OpenClaw Admin

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 83 ✓, 84 ✗

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Refresh the app UI to align with the OpenClaw Admin aesthetic and layout, including agent-focused navigation and tool access panels.

**Details:**

Implement a dark, dense admin layout with left rail agent list, top nav, and a main panel for agent details (tabs for Soul/User/Agents/Memory/Tools/Skills). Plan placement for team/member management (org chart-style) and future agent-to-agent reporting. Use shadcn/ui primitives + Tailwind. Stub missing data where necessary.

**Test Strategy:**

Manual review of core screens and responsiveness; verify navigation and primary panels render without runtime errors.
